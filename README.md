# hello-world
This is my first repository - scary!
In March 2020, after 20 years of providing end user desktop support, plunged into the world of professional IT administration.
This has plunged me further into new worlds, like coding, ethical hacking, and server and network administration.
I'm 43, and I hope my brain doesn't burn up from all the new things I'm learning.
